val_img_00111.png	Leaning back carries the concealed message . And we

val_img_00114.png	really interrogations to examine into the principles of the four re-

val_img_00120.png	to help them to face whatever it is that
val_img_00121.png	of use telling even children , as I have
val_img_00122.png	irrational pre-conceived notions - or to
val_img_00123.png	fears are based upon completely
val_img_00124.png	to pull themselves together . Far better
val_img_00125.png	cause and then deal with it ; show it
val_img_00126.png	In the first place it is not a great deal
val_img_00127.png	already suggested , not to be silly or
val_img_00128.png	is worrying them , to find the original

val_img_00131.png	There are several instances where he seemed unable to go
val_img_00132.png	too many details , would help many a child to make a
val_img_00133.png	proper adjustment to life as it grows up . Let us look
val_img_00134.png	A little more honesty , even if one refrains from going into
val_img_00135.png	at Jesus . We do not , I think , see there a life without fear .
val_img_00136.png	Amen . MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a
val_img_00137.png	partly true . Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
val_img_00138.png	purely physical thing . The cure for which is sleep . This is only
val_img_00139.png	amount of rest seems to make any difference . Sleep , to be
val_img_00140.png	from innocence .
val_img_00141.png	effective , must be of that child-like quality which comes
val_img_00142.png	Nor is she necessarily being deceitful . She really did feel tired
val_img_00143.png	with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion . A
val_img_00144.png	disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense
val_img_00145.png	of fatigue . They wonder why they get no rest at night ,
val_img_00146.png	until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an
val_img_00147.png	attractive - interest ! Tiredness has , therefore , as much to do
val_img_00148.png	even if they do sleep .
val_img_00149.png	we lose this way in the course of a day we would be
val_img_00150.png	staggered . Some of it is inevitable , and we do not want to
val_img_00151.png	through .
val_img_00152.png	If we ever stopped to consider how much energy - and time -
val_img_00153.png	become too pernickety . Nevertheless , we could all probably
val_img_00154.png	be a little more orderly for we so frequently just muddle
val_img_00155.png	worse the school system whereby for
val_img_00156.png	a critic may say - you are calling
val_img_00157.png	they say , to get into a rut . Save us
val_img_00158.png	us to adventure , do not strangle us before
val_img_00159.png	exactly what , on any given day of the
val_img_00160.png	we start by putting us into a strait-jacket
val_img_00161.png	routine destroys the soul . It is so easy ,
val_img_00162.png	from the school curriculum and even
val_img_00163.png	There may be some who will argue that
val_img_00164.png	week , they are going to have . If - such
val_img_00165.png	meals everybody knows beforehand
val_img_00166.png	that he was a great man for lace - paying
val_img_00167.png	didn't mean he was prepared to do as much
val_img_00168.png	and I fell out about my not being willing
val_img_00169.png	as much as 3 for a lace collar . But this
val_img_00170.png	We know from the diaries of Samuel Pepys
val_img_00171.png	to have her gown laced . '

val_img_00175.png	among the effects left by Nell Gwyn is an
val_img_00176.png	unpaid bill for ' scarlet satin shoes with
val_img_00177.png	kercher with a broad hem laced round with
val_img_00178.png	silver lace ' . The records of these tender trifles
val_img_00179.png	are very touching but then lace does place
val_img_00180.png	upon everything a delicate sentiment .

val_img_00348.png	Vicar of St. Mark's , Woodcote , Purley , a new church built
val_img_00349.png	IN 1913 Dr. Burge , Bishop of Southwark , asked me to go as
val_img_00350.png	ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield , we held
val_img_00351.png	great family consultations .
val_img_00352.png	later on joint executor of his estate with his
val_img_00353.png	by the well-known architect Mr. George Fellowes Prynne ,
val_img_00354.png	a close friend of ours .
val_img_00355.png	his family , and found a very suitable house nearby
val_img_00356.png	Dr. John Leake , who lived at Blackheath , and was
val_img_00357.png	My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with
val_img_00358.png	at the age of 92 . Dr. Burge was not able to be present
val_img_00359.png	This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich ,
val_img_00360.png	where my mother settled , and eventually died in 1926
val_img_00361.png	at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's .
val_img_00362.png	This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went
val_img_00363.png	service . I soon saw that the parish needed
val_img_00364.png	a flourishing Sunday School and an evening
val_img_00365.png	We also had a little Mission Hall leading off
val_img_00366.png	sounding name of Lansdowne Road . There
val_img_00367.png	district .
val_img_00368.png	were lots of children there , and we had
val_img_00369.png	the Brighton Road , in a street full of small houses .
val_img_00370.png	there , but was soon changed into the better-
val_img_00371.png	more help both at the church and Mission
val_img_00372.png	district and got to know , and be known by , many of
val_img_00373.png	the people of the parish .
val_img_00374.png	Most fortunately I was able to engage the Rev. E. U. Evitt in
val_img_00375.png	Lansdowne Road district , but I needed more help in the
val_img_00376.png	The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the
val_img_00377.png	1913 soon after I had come , and he organized the Mission
val_img_00378.png	church for the full rota of services on Sundays and weekdays .
val_img_00379.png	that one of us must volunteer . The Bishop , Dr. Burge , did
val_img_00380.png	not wish me to go then , as I had barely been in the parish
val_img_00381.png	A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following
val_img_00382.png	the Forces were urgently needed , and I felt clearly
val_img_00383.png	than his Vicar , and he was accepted at once and
val_img_00384.png	work until his health broke down and he had a bad
val_img_00385.png	year , 1914 , when war broke out . Very soon Chaplains for
val_img_00386.png	was very soon in France where he did splendid
val_img_00387.png	for a year . Mr. Evitt , however , was much less committed
val_img_00388.png	attack of enteric fever .
val_img_00389.png	the date of birth of each child , as had been done
val_img_00390.png	been married . It was not regarded as practicable within
val_img_00391.png	except that they extended to all women who were or had
val_img_00392.png	in the specialised enquiry for the Royal Commission .
val_img_00393.png	the limits of the census to include particulars about
val_img_00394.png	The questions about children were the same as in 1951 ,
val_img_00395.png	went dead again , and Steve had no stomach for
val_img_00396.png	should be . Steve got out the car and traversed the
val_img_00397.png	in Sussex , in all its obscene details . Then the radio
val_img_00398.png	After what seemed an undue period of repetition , the voice
val_img_00399.png	to keep an appointment with Heather .
val_img_00400.png	went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony
val_img_00401.png	same empty streets as he had the night before ,
val_img_00402.png	breakfast . It was a beautiful day , as firsts-of-June
val_img_00403.png	them .
val_img_00404.png	among our own people , finding out just how
val_img_00405.png	We must learn all we can about
val_img_00406.png	And third , to study these damned Thetans .
val_img_00407.png	much freedom we can take with safety .
val_img_00408.png	" Now , to summarize what I think our
val_img_00409.png	Thetans like the plague , for they must not
val_img_00410.png	course of action should be . First , to avoid the
val_img_00411.png	find us out ! Second , to tread pretty warily
val_img_00412.png	seats some rows behind him . Steve was
val_img_00413.png	faces very disconcerting ; and looking at
val_img_00414.png	Heather he found a welcome relief in her
val_img_00415.png	followed the beaming Dan aboard , taking
val_img_00416.png	beginning to find the stereotyped , flattish , happy
val_img_00417.png	After a long wait a bus appeared and they
val_img_00418.png	relatively long doleful one
val_img_00419.png	expenses , with the people to whom Moke had
val_img_00420.png	lucky to have descended from such economic altitudes .
val_img_00421.png	Tom Dreyfus had a job on the machines in the Secretariat
val_img_00422.png	( Stamp Department ) while Sally sulked at home .
val_img_00423.png	The recovery of his balance was due to the
val_img_00424.png	sent him : little people who regarded him as
val_img_00425.png	fact that he was living , virtually without

val_img_00427.png	Know how he did it ? He 's clever on

val_img_00431.png	the mouth-organ . So when he visited some
val_img_00432.png	sentences of his speech : ' Cut the
val_img_00433.png	Back-Face area ) the cry would go up ,
val_img_00434.png	the Senator who had annoyed the United States

val_img_00437.png	saying that if Mo land-troops had to come to the aid
val_img_00438.png	Peron entered , a large man , who had once been
val_img_00439.png	wore , and kept on indoors , a fifty gallon hat . Harry was
val_img_00440.png	by bragging how he had once won a trick from
val_img_00441.png	rockets ( an admission which would scarcely help
val_img_00442.png	handsome but was now seedy-looking , a sufferer
val_img_00443.png	prepared for something unpleasant , for this was
val_img_00444.png	of the O.G.O. contingent in the Panama region ,
val_img_00445.png	from stomach-ulcers . In the Back-Face tradition he
val_img_00446.png	ding scale , and left the sum-total of their actions ,
val_img_00447.png	be a centre of trust , responsible for the maintenance
val_img_00448.png	pressed as when he left Mrs. Halliday's office ,
val_img_00449.png	serve this home of his , in which his heart lay .
val_img_00450.png	Here the rocket man's charm was disarming . Yet
val_img_00451.png	when the time came to leave , Harry felt as de-
val_img_00452.png	The motive would be the same in both cases , to
val_img_00453.png	did what they had to do to get GO on an expan-
val_img_00454.png	exactly a month ago . If even Mo statesmen only
val_img_00455.png	and their lunar and earthly repercussions , to luck
val_img_00456.png	( or to Moke ) , there was a vacuum where there should

val_img_00458.png	the parade .
val_img_00459.png	turn . By comparing personal appearances
val_img_00460.png	with university records , the agents of the
val_img_00461.png	managers of corporations , together with professors
val_img_00462.png	were now being bought forward in their

val_img_00471.png	Moke consciously or unconsciously symbolised , any-
val_img_00472.png	circles , Harry had the feeling that Moke ( or what
val_img_00473.png	people by the short hairs , and was diverting them ...
val_img_00474.png	But since starting salaries would depend on grade A
val_img_00475.png	economic and biological ends which , essentially ,
val_img_00476.png	or B in the finals next May , and since mating

val_img_00478.png	with black , matted hair and a striking
val_img_00479.png	hesitation in saying that they would have
val_img_00480.png	resemblance to the shrunk heads we had
val_img_00481.png	made an end of us but for an intervention
val_img_00482.png	compels me to mention it .
val_img_00483.png	Small , repulsive creatures they were ,
val_img_00484.png	so unexpected , so unusual , that only the
val_img_00485.png	necessity of rounding my narrative
val_img_00486.png	gazed at recently ; and I have no

val_img_00495.png	I had a distinct impression that the
val_img_00496.png	Caught by a sudden gust of wind ? A
val_img_00497.png	too carefree , and becoming airborne ?
val_img_00498.png	single-decker Welsh bus could have got

val_img_00502.png	to know . But the fact remains that get
val_img_00503.png	itself into orbit it did .
val_img_00504.png	And a fine old fuss there was about it , too .
val_img_00505.png	Rev. Edwards .

val_img_00509.png	Thomas and her five-year-old son Cadwallader ;
val_img_00510.png	Here are the known facts . On 10th July ,

val_img_00519.png	Yes , the bus set out from Dinas . So much
val_img_00520.png	watched it go from the windows of the
val_img_00521.png	fully-fledged schoolteacher .

val_img_00525.png	said wretchedly , wiping his hands on his

val_img_00529.png	" But I 'm only going fifteen miles away , "
val_img_00530.png	will not be remembering a mere garage
val_img_00531.png	Morfydd was saying . " Not the end of

val_img_00536.png	A nice boy of course . But perhaps in the
val_img_00537.png	to offer . The conductor rang his bell .

val_img_00544.png	But the jet aircraft was already miles away ,
val_img_00545.png	climbing steadily . " Group Captain Llewelyn Jones , Officer
val_img_00546.png	Commanding R.A.F. Station , Dinas , looked keenly at the
val_img_00547.png	sort of rocket ? "
val_img_00548.png	Group Captain looked . " Broughtons , " he said silkily .
val_img_00549.png	Flying Officer Broughtons shuffled his feet .
val_img_00550.png	determined . " It was a bus , sir .
val_img_00551.png	Buses crawl . " Very pale , Broughtons was . But
val_img_00552.png	earth-bound creatures ? Aeroplanes fly , Broughtons .
val_img_00553.png	A single-decker , " he elaborated . Daggers , the
val_img_00554.png	" Didn't they teach you at Cranwell that buses are
val_img_00555.png	" Well , actually , sir , it looked like - like a bus .
val_img_00556.png	back in his chair . " I see . So you met a bus at
val_img_00557.png	fifty thousand feet .
val_img_00558.png	sir . It said Llangrwl . " Llewelyn Jones sat
val_img_00559.png	They 'd got the lights on . There were people inside .
val_img_00560.png	" Did you see the indicator board ? " " Yes , sir . " " And
val_img_00561.png	what did it say ? Mystery Tour ? " Oh , very caustic , that
val_img_00562.png	Group Captain . But Broughtons stood his ground . " No ,
val_img_00563.png	Waving . " Like gimlets , the Station Commander's eyes .
val_img_00564.png	All lit up . Full of people waving as you went past . "
val_img_00565.png	there were anything in Queen's Regulations to cover this ,
val_img_00566.png	isn't , " he ended sadly . " I tried to read the
val_img_00567.png	Suddenly he crouched forward . " Broughtons , if I thought

val_img_00572.png	quarter-hour intervals , regular as clockwork ?
val_img_00573.png	Time passed . Everyone said , " Pity about Megan

val_img_00582.png	Dinas Advertiser . But the London papers ignored
val_img_00583.png	they could have measured up the road and
val_img_00584.png	LOCAL BUS DISAPPEARS announced the
val_img_00585.png	the whole affair . Ifor Evans reported his loss

val_img_00587.png	taken an interest .
val_img_00588.png	a bus , is it . Very careless . " That was their
val_img_00589.png	to the police . But they only tut-tutted . " Lost

val_img_00598.png	what does such a person do ? He signals
val_img_00599.png	that of a castaway on a desert island . Now
val_img_00600.png	his position by lighting bonfires or hoisting a
val_img_00601.png	position , " he said , " is somewhat analogous to
val_img_00602.png	Well , the Rev. Edwards had taken command . " Our
val_img_00603.png	flag on a palm tree . And he tries to ensure
val_img_00604.png	" Can't go lighting bonfires on this bus , "
val_img_00605.png	the minister . " No , we have another way of signalling
val_img_00606.png	continuously . " Gave him a look , the driver did .
val_img_00607.png	Company's Regulations . " " Of course not , " agreed
val_img_00608.png	our position . The driver must sound his horn
val_img_00609.png	the conductor said firmly . " Contrary to the
val_img_00610.png	" Dinas High Street ? "
val_img_00611.png	" Where you think we are ? " he asked rudely .
val_img_00612.png	" Then we are saved , " cried the Rev. Edwards .

val_img_00734.png	" I don't want it to happen again , " said Bawley -
val_img_00735.png	" What did Munyard say ? " " The Snort - hull

val_img_00744.png	I 'll tell my editor that the story 's a dead bird .

val_img_00746.png	for calling , " he said . " Still long as you 're here

val_img_00748.png	shack , his rifle at the ready , I saw it was Nick
val_img_00749.png	I saw several men running down towards

val_img_00751.png	you may as well stay a while .
val_img_00752.png	the shack . They were all armed with rifles .
val_img_00753.png	As the nearest of them came round the

val_img_00755.png	found us a couple of boxes to sit on .
val_img_00756.png	miners followed in at our heels . Nick Dowd
val_img_00757.png	'Light an' come on in . " We dismounted and
val_img_00758.png	We followed Nick Dowd into the shack .
val_img_00759.png	Nick Dowd took our horses off to water .
val_img_00760.png	They 'd rigged up a stove of sorts and on it
val_img_00761.png	one of the miners who 'd come along with
val_img_00762.png	a huge blackened coffee-pot steamed . Other
val_img_00763.png	the little hombre in big overalls . Very soon he

val_img_00768.png	exactly the Ritz Hotel but we 've got our little
val_img_00769.png	there were two plates of beans .
val_img_00770.png	comforts , " said Dowd . He introduced the men
val_img_00771.png	had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee
val_img_00772.png	Golightly , Swede and the Sodbuster . This last was
val_img_00773.png	night . "
val_img_00774.png	as of now , apart from a few sacks of gold
val_img_00775.png	we 'd finished and I 'd rolled a cigarette
val_img_00776.png	watched us as we ate the beans . Then when
val_img_00777.png	the man called Shorty said , " You were saying when
val_img_00778.png	you came in that 2somep'n happened last
val_img_00779.png	dust . " He winked at his partners . They all
val_img_00780.png	handing them to us , " but it 's all we got

val_img_00783.png	down William Appleton outside the Palace
val_img_00784.png	words affect them in their different ways .
val_img_00785.png	" That 's sure bad news , " said Dowd , sombrely .
val_img_00786.png	" Yes , " I said . " Something happened all right .
val_img_00787.png	looked across at Nick Dowd - " someone cut
val_img_00788.png	with a shotgun . " I paused and watched my
val_img_00789.png	for Mr. Pell and his bunch , " observed
val_img_00790.png	" It 2jest about leaves everything wide open
val_img_00791.png	After you 'd left the meeting , mister " - I
val_img_00792.png	The rest of the men there said nothing but
val_img_00793.png	right 2hyar , Nick , " said the Sodbuster .
val_img_00794.png	desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
val_img_00795.png	digging for gold but were babes in arms
val_img_00796.png	when it came to dealing with owlhooters and
val_img_00797.png	simple men who knew a lot maybe about
val_img_00798.png	you could see they were hard hit . They were
val_img_00799.png	rest . " I guess we 'd better hold onto the gold
val_img_00800.png	and got away with it . "
val_img_00801.png	at gun point either . They 've done it before
val_img_00802.png	necks before you can say ' knife ' . It wouldn't
val_img_00803.png	sure asking for trouble . They 'll be on your
val_img_00804.png	" Yeah , " said Dowd dubiously . " 2Mebbe we 'd
val_img_00805.png	better . " Surprisingly Dan Maffrey came in at
val_img_00806.png	be the first time they 've held up a diggings
val_img_00807.png	that point . " If you do , " he said , " you 'll be

val_img_00809.png	us and a few six-shooters . But most of us
val_img_00810.png	2ain't 2eddicated in shootin' . It 'd be a
val_img_00811.png	abide by what we said at the meeting , "
val_img_00812.png	" You 're 2durned tootin' , mister , " said the man
val_img_00813.png	called Roper Smith . " We 've got five rifles among
val_img_00814.png	2massacree , 2yessir . " " If you 'll take a chance
val_img_00815.png	on getting your gold to the bank , then we 'll
val_img_00816.png	three of them , no more . I reckon we can deal
val_img_00817.png	handsome offer so I chimed in too . " That
val_img_00818.png	with them all right . "
val_img_00819.png	with Dan Maffrey's aim to avenge himself
val_img_00820.png	and hold up the stage , it 'll be a couple or
val_img_00821.png	goes for me , gentlemen , " I said . " If they do try
val_img_00822.png	on the Fenton bunch but still it was a
val_img_00823.png	I couldn't quite see how all this fitted in
val_img_00824.png	Gay , sitting opposite Gavin on the terrace could
val_img_00825.png	to do that . " Gavin drained his glass
val_img_00826.png	hardly believe that she was the same girl ,
val_img_00827.png	and refilled it .
val_img_00828.png	Gavin raised his glass to her and smiled
val_img_00829.png	table for the first time a few days ago .
val_img_00830.png	and Gay's heart turned over . " I 'd like
val_img_00831.png	miserable , shy , who had sat at the little
val_img_00832.png	who is tough enough to change him . "
val_img_00833.png	you know , always , and you aren't the type
val_img_00834.png	trust him out of your sight and having to put on
val_img_00835.png	whenever he flirts with another woman . He will
val_img_00836.png	a brave face and pretend that you don't mind
val_img_00837.png	Hell . " Doc answered for her . " Just Hell . Never able to
val_img_00838.png	be the same , if you know what I mean . " " You sound
val_img_00839.png	like Alice in Wonderland , " Doc gently mocked her , " and
val_img_00840.png	I 'm glad you 're beginning to see that you 're wasting
val_img_00841.png	now that I do realise that , and in any case , " she added
val_img_00842.png	a little sadly , " if I did change Gavin , he wouldn't
val_img_00843.png	your time on that chap .
val_img_00844.png	Gay nodded . " I know that you 're right Doc , I think
val_img_00845.png	I 'd marry you myself . " Gay laughed , Doc was
val_img_00846.png	as it obviously appeared to everyone else .
val_img_00847.png	long for the right man for you to come
val_img_00848.png	so kind and nice and she hoped that one
val_img_00849.png	Now let him go and you won't have to wait
val_img_00850.png	day she would be able to see the situation
val_img_00851.png	along . If I was thirty years younger and weren't
val_img_00852.png	married to the sweetest wife in the world
val_img_00853.png	" I made it myself , " Gay tried to speak
val_img_00854.png	normally .
val_img_00855.png	the roundabout , which was
val_img_00856.png	least . She would think of her-
val_img_00857.png	new seat outside the hospital
val_img_00858.png	thoughts . At one time she had
val_img_00859.png	self as a stranger in these parts
val_img_00860.png	out of operation - in theory , at
val_img_00861.png	gates and thought vagrant
val_img_00862.png	watched the workmen constructing
val_img_00863.png	studying these cross-roads . Which
val_img_00864.png	one to take ?
val_img_00865.png	Diana Wills often sat on the brand
val_img_00866.png	to put St. John's Casualty Department
val_img_00867.png	" If I were a tramp I would simply blow a
val_img_00868.png	airy directions accordingly . " If I were needing a
val_img_00869.png	women doctors to blow a feather and follow its
val_img_00870.png	job I 'd go to London , of course , " she went on .
val_img_00871.png	wishing life would sometimes allow serious-minded
val_img_00872.png	feather , " she decided , rather envying the gentle-
val_img_00873.png	man of the road his freedom of decision , and
val_img_00874.png	all important . "
val_img_00875.png	I got a good look at her . But if Nigel
val_img_00876.png	" Neither can Nigel , " smiled Diana .
val_img_00877.png	I know ? " she smiled . " I think so .
val_img_00878.png	" No , " Di said immediately . " It isn't at
val_img_00879.png	wasn't there it isn't important , is it ? "
val_img_00880.png	" I remember , " quipped the houseman ,
val_img_00881.png	That blonde was something . " " Anybody
val_img_00882.png	meaning no offence , " but does he ?
val_img_00883.png	" He 's saving up to get married . Remember ? "
val_img_00884.png	But after that slight slip of the tongue on Nigel's part she had
val_img_00885.png	with a cyst on her ear ... ? "
val_img_00886.png	" Nigel , " she had besought him , " you know that evening
val_img_00887.png	you took Luke Parson's surgery and there was a woman
val_img_00888.png	realised it was important enough for her to have remembered , and it
val_img_00889.png	made her think there was an abyss immediately ahead .
val_img_00890.png	was as though a red mist veiled her usually clear sight and
val_img_00891.png	broken down outside and he noticed
val_img_00892.png	you this , too ? " " No , " she laughed .
val_img_00893.png	at the roots and I had a redhead on
val_img_00894.png	it was your car I suppose he
val_img_00895.png	" Oh , he wasn't . His motor-bike had
val_img_00896.png	" He didn't actually see you . Because
val_img_00897.png	presumed it was you , all dressed up in
val_img_00898.png	your car and then you dancing with
val_img_00899.png	the other arm . He would have told
val_img_00900.png	this blonde . " " Really ? " Nigel cocked
val_img_00901.png	one eyebrow . " Actually she was brunette
val_img_00902.png	evening . " " No , don't , " he said , after
val_img_00903.png	particular surgery ? " " You are a fool ,
val_img_00904.png	" Now I wonder which I wore at that
val_img_00905.png	" My white or my black ? " Nigel enquired .
val_img_00906.png	the housemen think of me as a
val_img_00907.png	two-timing Don Juan .
val_img_00908.png	exactly what you were doing that
val_img_00909.png	kissing her again . " I rather like to have
val_img_00910.png	darling , " Di said happily . " I shall take
val_img_00911.png	great pleasure in telling that young man
val_img_00912.png	" You need your holiday , darling . I only
val_img_00913.png	I 'm such a dull fellow , really . " " Dull ? " She
val_img_00914.png	couldn't believe it . Self-deprecation
val_img_00915.png	I suppose ? " she enquired archly .
val_img_00916.png	wish I could go with you ! " " Doctor
val_img_00917.png	" It would make me more interesting ,
val_img_00918.png	was not one of Nigel's usual attributes .
val_img_00919.png	Wills , if you 're making improper suggestions ... ? "
val_img_00920.png	" No , it wouldn't ! " he almost snapped ,
val_img_00921.png	leave in the autumn without you
val_img_00922.png	become you to behave like a - a tart , Di . "
val_img_00923.png	body else for a moment there . It doesn't
val_img_00924.png	miserable enough my having to take my
val_img_00925.png	" Nigel - ! " she gasped . " I didn't mean to
val_img_00926.png	behave like anything of the kind . I
val_img_00927.png	trying to be bright and gay about it .
val_img_00928.png	surprising her . " You sounded like some-
val_img_00929.png	was only joking . " " Well , don't . It 's
val_img_00930.png	at this time of year ? I can't ask you up because it 's
val_img_00931.png	can't imagine the hospital without me for
val_img_00932.png	a strictly stag affair . " " I know . I didn't expect ... " " Well ,
val_img_00933.png	three weeks , etcetera , etcetera ! "
val_img_00934.png	come with me ; you hope I 'll miss you ; you
val_img_00935.png	don't keep hinting , then . You wish you could
val_img_00936.png	I 'm going with a shooting party . What else can I do
val_img_00937.png	regard first . " I would mind if you didn't " he told her
val_img_00938.png	right , pet . I do need this leave . I 'm bad-tempered and
val_img_00939.png	Her figure was small and exquisite , like a schoolgirl's still , and
val_img_00940.png	broody and going out with brash blondes . I don't deserve
val_img_00941.png	he admired her legs , which the male sex were inclined to
val_img_00942.png	grimly , and tugged her fiercely into his arms . " You 're
val_img_00943.png	you . "
val_img_00944.png	make all the waiting worth while . When we 're
val_img_00945.png	" Darling ! " her voiced caressed him . " Moments like this
val_img_00946.png	married we won't have these explosions of emotion ,
val_img_00947.png	isn't as bad as an operation , Nigel ! "
val_img_00948.png	will we ? " " No , " he eyed her strangely . " I wish we
val_img_00949.png	were married , Di . Like a patient wishes his operation
val_img_00950.png	was over . " Again her laughter trilled . " Marriage
val_img_00951.png	me isn't going to be all that bad ?
val_img_00952.png	the moment , thank God ! " Problem ... ?
val_img_00953.png	he could be serious . " Surely marrying
val_img_00954.png	" Isn't it ? " he rose and smoothed himself
val_img_00955.png	or a burial ? " she asked , hardly believing
val_img_00956.png	looming ... ? " Are we discussing a marriage
val_img_00957.png	down . " Ask any bridegroom-to-be . Anyhow ,
val_img_00958.png	that particular problem isn't looming at
val_img_00959.png	it , looking moodily beyond her . " Perhaps it 's as
val_img_00960.png	well if you don't wear it for a bit , Di , " he
val_img_00961.png	of amusement in his own eyes , however , he took
val_img_00962.png	your ring back . " She loosened the half-hoop of
val_img_00963.png	diamonds on her left hand third finger and held it
val_img_00964.png	told her .
val_img_00965.png	out to him , still playfully . Without a glimmer
val_img_00966.png	If it is - " she laughed uncertainly - " you can have
val_img_00967.png	doctor would be free during the day ; tea was served
val_img_00968.png	from four until five-thirty in the residents' common-
val_img_00969.png	she was convinced , or he would have granted her small request
val_img_00970.png	Something had cropped up which required Nigel's attention ,
val_img_00971.png	room , which proved the elasticity of medical commitments .
val_img_00972.png	Diana was trailing up the gravelled drive to the hospital
val_img_00973.png	to be met at the gates .
val_img_00974.png	alone . Of course one couldn't say for certain when a
val_img_00975.png	Thus had they parted the previous evening and now
